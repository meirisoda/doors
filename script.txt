Try hovering your cursor over this text. What do you see? 
The background moves in accordance to where your cursor is on the viewport. 

It's kind of cool. The first time I found this almost neumorphism-esque way to write hover effects, I thought it could just be something to play around with. Try hovering your cursor in and out of the button boundary. 

Now for a question. 
What is interactivity? 

If you want a really technical answer, the definition of 'interactive' (according to the Oxford Dictory) means: 
1. Reciprocally active; acting upon or influencing each other. 
	or 
2. Pertaining to or being a computer or other electronic device that llows a two-way flow of information between and a user, responding immediately to the latter input.


If I wanted to make this button interactive, does it mean that it needs to give you a response once you press it? If the button didn't give you an immediate feedback response, would it just be static and "non-interactive"? This button could just be here and give you nothing in return (except for that sweet, sweet effect when you hover in and out of its border). 

But this definition can be very easily re-interpreted and applied into different circumstances. 


"The screen forms a bridge between our bodies and the realm of circuits and electricity inside computers." (source:) This screen displaying this website is a bridge between the words I've written and your eyes. 
 

I could argue that this button is interactive because you are interacting with it just by reading the text on the page.
