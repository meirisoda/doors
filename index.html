			Try hovering your cursor over this text. What do you see? <br>
			The background moves in accordance to where your cursor is on the viewport. <br>
				<br>
			It's kind of cool. The first time I found this almost neumorphism-esque way to write hover effects, I thought it could just be something to play around with. Keep moving your cursor in and out of the button boundary. <br>
				<br>
			Now for a question. <i>What is interactivity?</i> <br>
				<br>
			If you want a really technical answer, the definition of "interactive" (according to the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/97521?" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionary</a>) means: <br>
			1. Reciprocally active; acting upon or influencing each other. <br>
				&emsp;&emsp;or <br>
			2. Pertaining to or being a computer or other electronic device that llows a two-way flow of information between and a user, responding immediately to the latter input.<br>
				<br>
			If I wanted to make this button interactive, does it mean that it needs to give you a response once you press it? If the button didn't give you an immediate feedback response, would it just be static and "non-interactive"? This button could just <b>exist</b> and give you nothing in return (except for that sweet, sweet effect when you hover in and out of its border). <br>
				<br>
				<br>
			But this Oxford definition can be very easily re-interpreted and applied into different circumstances. <br>
				<br>
			"The screen forms a bridge between our bodies and the realm of circuits and electricity inside computers." (<a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/interactivity">source</a>, please read the introduction - it's actually quite interesting). This screen is displaying this website which is displaying text that I've written. 
			<br>
			<br>It is a bridge between my thoughts and your eyes and thus is exchanging information, an interaction, between the two of us.<br>
				<br>
			Now click on the button you've been hovering over.
